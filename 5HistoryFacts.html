                According to two ancient accounts, it has been said that Caesar drew inspiration from Alexander the Great, the legendary king and conqueror of Macedonia. When traveling in Cadiz (modern day Spain), Caesar came across a bust of Alexander the Great. Being over 30 years old, yet had accomplished nothing that he tought was worthwhile. Alexander had achieve much before his death at just 32 years old, so he decided it was time for him to make a change in his own life. This inpired Caesar to attain the ambition he needed to do whatever it took to prove himeself and his family name.

                Christmas is a time for celebration but the festive season was once banned in England for almost 20 years, sparking a second Civil War. The ban was put in place by the Puritan government in 1647 as they believed Christas was used as an excuse for drunknness, promiscuity, gambling and other forms of excess. Puritans saw Christmas as a Pagan festival and claimed the 25th December was not a named day in the bible. They enforced the ban on Christmas and all shops and markets had to stay open and many churches were locked to prevent them holding a Christmas service. The public responded violently to the ban and there were disturbances across the country. One of the worst hotspots was Canterbury where violent looting and rioting broke out the first Christmas after the ban was imposed.
