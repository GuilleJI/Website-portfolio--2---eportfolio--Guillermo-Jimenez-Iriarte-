                According to two ancient accounts, it has been said that Caesar drew inspiration from Alexander the Great, the legendary king and conqueror of Macedonia. When traveling in Cadiz (modern day Spain), Caesar came across a bust of Alexander the Great. Being over 30 years old, yet had accomplished nothing that he tought was worthwhile. Alexander had achieve much before his death at just 32 years old, so he decided it was time for him to make a change in his own life. This inpired Caesar to attain the ambition he needed to do whatever it took to prove himeself and his family name.
